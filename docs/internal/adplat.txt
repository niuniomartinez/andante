This document explains how to add a new platform system to the library.

1.- Get a name for the new platform.

    The name should be less than eight characters long.

2.- Create a new subdirectory in the 'src/lib' directory named as the platform.

3.- Copy the contents of the 'src/lib/foo' directory to the new directory.

    The 'foo' platform contains the bare minimun to compile without errors, but
    it is empty.  It just defines the scafolding of the platform.

4.- Open files 'fix.bat', 'fix.cmd' and/or 'fix.sh' and add the new platform.

    You just need to copy one of the  other platforms and modify the "TARGET"
    assignation with the new name.

    Don't forget to add the name in the "help" text.

5.- Open 'makefile' and add the target definition at the beginning.  Use one
    of the given platforms as a template.  You don't need to change anything
    else.

6.- Compile the examples to be sure that it works.  The examples won't work.
    Don't worry because here it comes the...

7.- ... last step:  go to the platform directory and add code to the given
    files.
