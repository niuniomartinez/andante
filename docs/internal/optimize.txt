Some notes about optimizations:

- Nested records doesn't adds code. For example:

  Value.Compound.Field := 8;

  Generates the exact same assembler code than:

  Value.Field := 8;

  Also this code:

  Value^.Compound.Field := 8;

  Generates the exact same assembler code than:

  Value^.Field := 8;

  BUT code:

  Value^.Compound^.Field := 8;

  generates more code than:

  Value^.Compound.Field := 8;

  (I know, last statements seems ovbious but sometimes the obvious is hidden)
