Welcome to the Andante Documentation Directory
==============================================

  This directory contains all documentation of the Andante library.  Read it
  carefully before to use the library or move to other documents.

  Note tha the library is in a early development, so a lot may change before
  the first stable version (1.0).



How to compile the examples
---------------------------

  To compile the examples you need Free Pascal installed, including the 'make'
  utility.  [https://www.freepascal.org/]  Remember that Lazarus includes
  Free Pascal.

  Note:  If you have problems running or installing Free Pascal on MS-DOS or
  FreeDOS, try to install it on any DOS based Windows (Windows Millenium Edition
  (me) or older should work, but I recommend Windows XP or Windows 95).  You can
  use a cross-compiling version of Free Pascal too.

  On Linux and Windows you need Allegro.pas too.

  Once you have everything installed, go to the directory where you unzipped
  Andante, then execute the "fix" script and launch the makefile.  Let's say
  you unzipped Andante in the C: unit.  Then you should do that:

  Z:\>C:
  C:\>CD ANDANTE
  C:\ANDANTE>FIX.BAT DOS
  Configuring for DOS/FPC...
  Done!
  C:\ANDANTE>MAKE
  Andante

  Finished all examples.
  Finished Andante.
  To create the documentation, run make docs.
  C:\ANDANTE>CD BIN\EXAMPLES
  C:\ANDANTE\BIN\EXAMPLES>DIR



Documentation
-------------

  Right now, documentation should be created.

  First, install the pasdoc utility [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc].

  Then move the the Andante directory and execurte "MAKE DOCS".  Documentation
  will be stored in the 'docs/lib' directory in HTML5 format.



Using Andante
-------------

  To use Andante in your game you only need 'src/lib' directory, and pass to the
  compiler (i.e. the -Fu and -Fi options) that directory and the platform
  directory.  For example, to compile for DOS:

  fpc mygame.pas -Fuandante -Fuandante\dos -Fiandante\dos

  And for Windows or Linux:

  fpc mygame.pas -Fuandante -Fuandante\allegro -Fiandante\allegro

  Do not use '*' or the compiler may not find the appropriate system units!
